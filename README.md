# Weather ETL and Visualization Pipeline ☀️🌦️ 

## Overview 🚀
This project demonstrates a complete weather data pipeline, starting from extracting raw weather data, transforming and loading it into a database, and finally visualizing the data using Power BI dashboards.

## Repository Structure 📂 
- `python/` : Contains Python scripts for ETL processing.
- `sql/` : Contains SQL query files for data exploration and transformations.
- `powerbi/` : Contains Power BI report files and visualization assets.
- `data/` (optional): Stores datasets or exported CSV files.
- `README.md` : Project documentation.

## How to Run ▶️ 
1. Run the Python ETL script to process weather data:  
```
python/weather_etl.py
```
2. Use the SQL queries from the `sql/` folder to explore or export data.
3. Import exported data into Power BI (`powerbi/` folder) to open and interact with dashboards.

## Future Enhancements 🚧 
- Automate the data pipeline with scheduling (e.g., cron jobs).
- Add real-time API data extraction.
- Deploy interactive dashboards on web platforms.
